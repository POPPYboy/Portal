# INTRODUCTION
Portal is a cross-platform tool designed to integrate the capabilities of ChatGPT into users' workflows.

## Shortcut
It allows users to send any selected text to ChatGPT for processing via a keyboard shortcut, and then return the result to the user's clipboard or at the cursor position (achieving a typewriter effect). This means that you can immediately access the power of ChatGPT in most applications that do not have access to ChatGPT capabilities.

## Multiple connections
Support multiple connection methods

## Agent Mode （plan）
Multiple file loading.
Browser mode.
